DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOCKER RUN AND DOCKER COMPOSE

The key difference between "docker run" versus "docker compose" is that docker run is entirely command line based, while docker-compose reads configuration data from a YAML file. 

The second major difference is that "docker run" can only start one container at a time, while "docker compose" will configure and run multiple.
In contrast to "docker run", "docker compose" allows for the configuration of multiple containers in a single YAML file. When the docker-compose up command runs, it will start every container referenced in the "docker-compose.yaml" file.

If you wanted to use an Nginx container to test your website on your desktop computer, there are two available approaches:

1. Start the Nginx container on the command line with docker run
2. Start the Nginx with the docker compose up and a preconfigured YAML file
