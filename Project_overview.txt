Parts of the project:

1. Website Explore California.

2. Dockerfile that allows us to run the website locally

3. Unit tests written with Rspec to test the website using Capybara and Selenium to run those tests.

4. Docker Compose so we can run all the commands in one place, together with the network that connects how all those pieces interact with wach other.

5. Service that allows us to use Terraform.
We use that Terraform service to deploy the website into AWS.

6. Simple storage service (S3) -> copying our website into S3 bucket
