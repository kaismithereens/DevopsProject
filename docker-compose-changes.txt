Changes to rspec.dockerfile:

- changed $PWD to '.' because PWD is not set for sudo users
- updated path to test file from 
  - '/app/spec/unit/page_spec.rb'
  to
  - 'spec/unit/page_spec.rb'

- since PWD is not set for sudo, if I set it during command invocation
  like here:
    sudo PWD=${PWD} docker compose run --rm unit-tests
  then I can use $PWD inside of docker environment as I have now
  injected it to the running container.
